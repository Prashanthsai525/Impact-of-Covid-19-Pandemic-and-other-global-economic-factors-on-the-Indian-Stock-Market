Stock trading is one of the most significant financial activities in this dynamically expanding 
economy. Stock price prediction is the act of finding the future worth of the firm stock and other 
financial assets traded on a marketplace. With economic uncertainty and a number of other 
dependent and independent variables that predict the rise and fall of the market, anticipation of 
stock price is one of the hardest tasks to do. Numerous models have been used since the advent of 
artificial intelligence to forecast the movement of the equities market.The effects of many elements 
in India, such as the festival season, changes in oil prices, the impact of an increase in gold prices, the 
covid-19 pandemic, and many other factors that affect stock values are compared using several 
machine learning modeling techniques in this study. Stock price forecasting will be done based on 
the examination of these elements. This paper presents the thorough investigation of the stock price 
forecast using yearly and historical data and an analysis of how Covid-19 pandemic, Oil Prices and 
Gold Prices impacted the Indian Stock Market.
